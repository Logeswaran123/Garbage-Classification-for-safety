# Garbage-Classification-for-safety
 
### Motivation
The motivation started by walking down my street abd seeing a huge garbage bin at the corner where all the houses in the street would dump their daily garbage. People would not try to seperate the recyclable and organic wastes but throw every type of trash together.

Every morning, as I am about to leave for my classes, I would see a garbage pick-up truck swing by and take up all the garbage. Even the garbage man does not know how to seperate all the trash.

So, I researched and found out that most of the garbages are either cleaned by hand, dump together in garbage dump fill or burnt together. In these cases, even material like plastic mix with organic dump and burnt. This not only affects the environment but also millions of dollars of money are lost because of not recycling such garbages.

This is the motivation behind the project, an humble but effective idea to segregate trash by different categories and thus reduce manpower and effects on environment and save up money by recycling.
